var ppl = 0;

<!--One question:
if the user clicks on the button (which
	opens the function more than once, would 
	the global variable reset?
Right now im assuming that the ppl var will keep
	track of the total number of profiles
	successfully created-->

function CreateProfile() {
  return a * a;
}
